# Cat Video Web App

This project is meant for those who love cats. Who doesn't enjoy binge watching our fuzzy friends? Well, I've made it much simpler with this app. In this project, I created and deployed a REST API containing cat videos on Heroku cloud platform, used JavaScript to pull data from my cat video API and add runtime event logic to the web app buttons, and embedded cat videos on an HTML file using React JavaScript framework and styled using CSS. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed Node.js and can access its modules
* You have reviewed the React documentation for running this app on your computer. The documentation is here: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
* General experience using React
* You have reviewed the documentation for the cat-video-api. The documentation is here: https://github.com/an288705/cat-video-api 

## Installing and using the cat app

To install the cat app, follow React documentation. Most of these files come with the npx create-react-app command, the only changes are in the src file. The Youtube.js file is the main script of this web app. 

Should you want to make changes to this app:
* Review that file and the comments I've made in the code. 
* You cannot change the API, and the changes must be able to embed youtube videos
